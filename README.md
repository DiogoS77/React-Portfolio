After installing everything you will need to run this following command in your terminal run (npm run start). After running this command you will see your localhost was made and you should be able to access your localhost and open the portfolio. Or you can use the github deployed application instead of the localhost. Also you can switch between dark and light mode by clicking in the sun emoji on top.
